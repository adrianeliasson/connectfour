# TODO connect 4

- Animated player mark dropping through the column (Late feature)
- Before dropping the mark, there should be an arrow showing where the mark will be dropped
- Select column by moving using arrow keys instead of typing a number (Default middle probably)
- Rerender board in place
- Actually allow winning (setup rules)
- When a player wins, color the row/column/diagonal that won (extra exp if you win by connecting 5+ marks)
- Database vs WebSocket
