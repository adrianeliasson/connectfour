# TODO connect 4
I like to be 

- [] Animated player mark dropping through the column (Late feature)
- [x] Before dropping the mark, there should be an arrow showing where the mark will be dropped
- [x] Select column by moving using arrow keys instead of typing a number (Default middle probably)
- [x] Rerender board in place
- [x] Actually allow winning (setup rules)
- [] When a player wins, color the row/column/diagonal that won (extra exp if you win by connecting 5+ marks)
- [] Database vs WebSocket
